# üß∞ Libft ‚Äì My First C Library

This project is part of the 42 School curriculum. **Libft** is a foundational static C library that reimplements a wide array of standard library functions, along with several additional utility functions. It provides a solid base for all future C projects at 42.

## üìñ About

The goal of Libft is to:

- Reinvent essential libc functions like `strlen`, `memcpy`, and `atoi`.
- Understand memory handling and pointer arithmetic in C.
- Create a personal library that can be reused in later projects.
- Practice rigorous coding standards (42 Norm).

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Part 1 ‚Äì Libc Functions

Reimplemented functions like:

- Character checkers: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, etc.
- Memory manipulation: `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, etc.
- String operations: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strlcpy`, `ft_strchr`, etc.
- Conversion: `ft_atoi`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`
- Memory allocation: `ft_calloc`, `ft_strdup`

### ‚úÖ Part 2 ‚Äì Bonus Functions

Utility functions:

- `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strtrim`
- `ft_split`, `ft_itoa`
- `ft_strmapi`, `ft_striteri`
- Output functions to file descriptor: `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, `ft_putendl_fd`, `ft_putnbr_fd`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build

To compile the library, run it on terminal:
$> make
